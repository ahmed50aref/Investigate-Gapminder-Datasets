# Investigate-Gapminder-Datasets
In this repository, I investigated 3 datasets from gapminder: life expectancy, total income per person, children per woman total fertility to answer some question related to these datasets with some visuals using "jupyter notebook" from [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) tools.

I wrote code with notes in file with ipynb (ipython notebook) extenison which can be opened by jupyter notebook. I also provided html verison which can be opend by any browser.
